## Intro

I'm about to start in my first *real* data science role in a few weeks, and that coupled with this[this](https://twitter.com/therriaultphd/status/1329080766593081345) recent Twitter thread prompted me to share my own data science journey. I'm going to share my background and how I ended up getting into data analysis/science. My background is non-traditional so it might be useful to others, but this is also an opportunity for me to reflect on where I am now and where I'm going. I won't make any attempt to generalize here (because, you know, n of 1) but I want to be clear about what did and didn't work for me.
